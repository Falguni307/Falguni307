### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a data science enthusiast. I have worked on Data science projects using Python and R. I have been working at Parmar Associates from last 3 years. Earlier, I did an internship at Bliss tech labs Pvt Ltd, Aurangabad as Front-end developer for an Android project.

In terms of Soft skills, I would think that I am good at some of those skills like the ability to see alternatives, in times when I get stuck at one problem and the normal route to solve the problem is not working, I take a deep breath, and start analysing the problem from start and think about it as to whether any important key point that was ignored by mistake or is there any other possible solution. I am a reliable person as I havenâ€™t missed any deadline. Sometimes I set deadlines for myself to get the work done before time because of which productivity increases and also I get some extra time to help my teammates and to solve any queries that are related to the project. Being able to work in a team helps me to understand my team and also other people get ideas which are different from mine. I am a fast worker, flexible and have a good grasping power which has helped me to learn many job-related skills in a short period. I believe that one can gain skills at any time.

I love to solve the problems and eager to get the answer quickly. I love to help other people who are stuck at some problem and if I know the answer I will help and teach them and If I donâ€™t know the answer, also if it is not related to me or my work, I look for its solution. I am a very curious person. If there is anything new or something that I donâ€™t know about any topic I love to work on, I will check that out, learn about it (not only theoretically but also practically) which helps me be better at my work also I get to help and learn from others.

Post Covid19 pandemic, the world needs to be a better place for everyone. Right now, there are lots of people who are becoming engineers, doctors, govt employees, etc. No doubt we need them. But to solve the world problems and to advance, the world needs people which are confident, have the knowledge and are skilled. Because of Covid-19, almost everything has been digitalized. Students are learning online, People are working online, entertainment, etc. This gives lots of people new opportunities to learn and grow. Although not everything can be digitalized, still most things which cannot be imagined are now in our reach and easily accessible which has improved our lives for better
